# QuickLookBPG

This is an open-source QuickLook plugin to generate thumbnails and previews for BPG images.

## Installation

- [Download the lastest version]()
- Unzip it
- Copy `QuickLookBPG.qlgenerator` into `/Library/QuickLook`

## Trouble?

If you’ve installed the plugin, but don’t see any changes, run `qlmanage -r` in the Terminal. This will restart QuickLook, which reloads all plugins.
